## Genki-gumi [gg] ğŸ˜Š

[Yakuza-themed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza){:target="_blank"} decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)) focused on managing and operating DAO members' digital assets to realize utility; income, growth and external influence.
At inception gg is a collection of digital assets focused in gaming, metaverse and governance, and a network of web3 frens who share the investment thesis that real-world value can be generated through the utility of certain digital assets. 

In our current state, assets are held by owners. We're a Discord of like-minded #degens investigating the best ways to move forward with gg. There are not currently any ggDAO contracts or tokens.
