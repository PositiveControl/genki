## Genki Gumi ðŸ˜Š


[Yakuza-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza) decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)) focused on managing and operating digital assets to realize utility; income, growth and external influence.


### Structure

Genki Gumi [gg] follows a traditional Yakuza family structure, headed by an _Oyabun_ and broken into two sections, _saiko-komon_ (administration - planning) and _gashira_ (lieutenant - execution). It is intended that the _Oyabun_ will be an automated role, executed by contracts via votes cast by all members.

_* note: this chart was taken from a google search and will eventually be altered to reflect gg roles more accurately_
